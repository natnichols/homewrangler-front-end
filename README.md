The goal of HomeWrangler is to help you spend **_less time & mental energy_** on those repetitive-yet-necessary household tasks. Groceries and home repairs can be logged with a few taps of a button. When you realize you're running low on milk, simply look in your digital pantry and add it to your shopping list. When you're at the hardware store, just look at your to-do list to see what you need. Decide how much money you want to set aside & reference it easily when shopping. HomeWrangler can help you wrangle it all! 

Our vision is to make y'all's life easier. We have more features planned for the future, so grab your saddle and join the posse!
